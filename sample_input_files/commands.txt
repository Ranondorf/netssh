"""This is the file where you define which commands you want to run against which devices.

There are several constructs that are in the file, I will go through all the pertinent ones.


Comments: Can be either single line or multiline. In fact now we are in a multiline comment block.

Multiline: The first characters on a line neeed to have """ and the last three characters of that line
or a later line need to be """. This is a comment block. Unlike python ''' will not work and """ are only
supported at the start or the end of the line, otherwise they are ignored.

Singleline: Single line comment is the # character at the start position of the line. Anywhere else it is
ignored.

Here is a sample use case of this file:

[cisco_ios]
sh clock
sh ver
[cisco_xr]
sh clock
sh ver
<test>
sh clock
<group_a>
[cisco_ios]
sh clock
sh ver

There are three main components to breakdown here: Type, Command and Group.

Type: Is specified in []. This designates the device type. This is common across the
      commands and devices file.

Group: is in <>. This defines a group of devices, it can be cross platform.
       The group is not mandatory. There is a default group called <DEFAULT>.
       All devices are in the default group unless explicitly assigned to something else.
       The default group can be specified by: <DEFAULT>, <> and <default>
       This is common across the commands and devices file.

Command: Are the commands to run, these should be compatible from device type.

So given the previous example, this is how items will be processed:

In the <default> group, [cisco_ios] devices will have sh clock and sh ver run. Again in the default group IOS [cisco_xr]
devices will run sh clock and sh ver.

In group <test>, [cisco_xr] devices will run only the sh clock command

In <group_a>, [cisco_ios] will run sh clock and sh ver

The comment block is over after the """ on the line below. Add your configuraiton after that.
