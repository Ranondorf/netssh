"""This is the file where you define the device names, types, groups and credentials.

There are several constructs that are in the file, I will go through all the pertinent ones.


Comments: Can be either single line or multiline. In fact now we are in a multiline comment block.

Multiline: The first characters on a line neeed to have """ and the last three characters of that line
or a later line need to be """. This is a comment block. Unlike python ''' will not work and """ are only
supported at the start or the end of the line, otherwise they are ignored.

Singleline: Single line comment is the # character at the start position of the line. Anywhere else it is
ignored.

Here is a sample use case of this file:

[cisco_ios]
router_1
switch_2
<cred_1>
<group_a>
switch_1
<DEFAULT>
[cisco_xr]
<cred_default>
router_2
<test>
router_3
router_4


There are four main components to breakdown here: Hosts, Type, Credentials and Group.

Hosts: These are the hostnames of IP addresses of the devices

Type: Is specified in []. This designates the device type.
     This is common across the commands and devices file.

Group: is in <>. This defines a group of devices, it can be cross platform.
       The group is not mandatory. There is a default group called <DEFAULT>.
       All devices are in the default group unless explicitly assigned to something else.
       The default group can be specified by: <DEFAULT>, <> and <default>
       This is common across the commands and devices file.

Credentials: Are in enclosed in <>. They are of the format <cred_default>, <cred_1>, <cred_2> and
             so on and so forth. These map to a creds file if it has been created. This allows for 
             using different credentials on different devices.

So given the previous example, this is how items will be processed:

router_1 and switch_2 are type [cisco_ios] and are in group <default> and they use credentials <cred_default>
switch_1 is of type [cisco_ios] and in group <group_a> and use credentials <cred_1>
router_2 is of type [cisco_xr] and in group <default> and uses <cred_default>
router_3 and router_4 are type [cisco_xr] and are in group <test> and use <cred_default>

The comment block is over after the """ on the line below. Add your configuraiton after that.
