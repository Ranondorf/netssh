# netssh
Script for SSHing into network devices.
Features:
- Handles lists of various device types as input
- Hanles differing lists of commands for different device types
- Can output as a single file or multiple files
- Output files can be zipped
- Output files can be emailed to multiple recipients
- Has a matching function where you can search for a string within a device
- Some broken features such as debug mode.
- Upcoming works are in the REQUESTS.txt
- Strongly recommend running this program from a different directory (i.e not the actual directory as the .py files). This allows you to keep you input and output files without cluttering thing up.
- There are default values assigned, but for ease of use, use the configuration file.
- Work in progress.
